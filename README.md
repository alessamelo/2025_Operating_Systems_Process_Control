# 2025_Operating_Systems_Process_Control
This project is focused on the development of a process monitoring system designed to ensure exam integrity by controlling the execution of system processes during an exam session. The application allows instructors to define a whitelist of authorized processes, while automatically detecting, blocking, and terminating any non-authorized applications that might indicate academic dishonesty.

Built using Python, the system includes a lightweight graphical interface and leverages real-time process tracking to monitor student activity. The instructor can remotely initiate and terminate monitoring sessions, log user identity for traceability, and receive alerts about violations. The goal is to offer a portable, easy-to-use solution that works across different machines, without requiring deep technical knowledge from users.

This project integrates system-level control, user authentication, and GUI/API design, offering a practical tool for maintaining a secure digital exam environment.
